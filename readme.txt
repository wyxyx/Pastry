2. What is working

We have implemented network join and routing as described in the Pastry paper and caculated the average number of hops (node connections) that have to be
traversed to deliver a message.

We also implemented failure models in Pastry network and tested them.

3. What is the largest network you managed to deal with?

We tested 10000 nodes to make 10 requests in about 40 minutes, and the average hop size is 2.8772.



Execution command:
